A few days ago, I was playing the video game **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker**. In this game, there's a **sliding puzzle mini-game**. The objective is to slide the pieces around to recreate the original image. And I quickly realized that I was terrible at it. It took me dozens of minutes to find the solution. Until I discovered that there were 15 more to complete! The question then arose: **are all the sliding puzzles solvable?**

The Wind Waker slidding puzzle is a $4 \times 4$ one, but let's talk about an easier one, a $3 \times 3$

The **sliding puzzle** is a well-known game consisting of an $n \times n$ grid (here, $3 \times 3$) containing $n^2 - 1$ numbered tiles from $1$ to $8$ and an empty space that allows tiles to be moved by sliding.

We will prove the solvability of the game and establish the maximum number of moves required to solve any given configuration.

***

# **Conditions for Solvability of the 3×3 Sliding Puzzle**

The question of solvability relies on the **parity of tile permutations**. Let’s define the necessary concepts.

## **Permutations and Invariants of the Game**

A sliding puzzle configuration is represented by a permutation of the numbers ${1, 2, ..., 8}$ and the empty space.

### **Number of Inversions**

The concept of **parity** is fundamental in determining whether a given configuration is **solvable**.

An **inversion** is a pair $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$, but tile $j$ appears before tile $i$ when reading the grid from left to right and top to bottom.

A permutation of tiles is classified as **even** or **odd** based on the **number of inversions** it contains:

- A permutation is **even** if the total number of inversions is even.
- A permutation is **odd** if this number is odd.

For example, consider the following initial configuration:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 8 & 3 \\
1 & 6 & 4 \\
7 & \_ & 5
\end{array}
$$

Ignoring the empty space, the sequence of numbers is:

$$
(2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 5)
$$

Counting the inversions:

- **2** precedes **1** → $(2,1)$ (1 inversion)
- **8** precedes **3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 5** → $(8,3), (8,1), (8,6), (8,4), (8,7), (8,5)$ (6 inversions)
- **3** precedes **1** → $(3,1)$ (1 inversion)
- **6** precedes **4, 5** → $(6,4), (6,5)$ (2 inversions)
- **4** precedes **1** → $(4,1)$ (1 inversion)
- **7** precedes **5** → $(7,5)$ (1 inversion)

Total inversions: $1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12$ (even number).

The **parity of the number of inversions** is defined as:

$$
\text{inv}(\sigma) = \sum\_{i < j} \mathbf{1}\_{\sigma(i) > \sigma(j)}
$$

where $\sigma(i)$ denotes the number at position $i$ in the configuration.

### **Parity of the Empty Tile Position**

In a $3 \times 3$ sliding puzzle, the configuration’s parity also depends on the **position of the empty tile**.

The **row of the empty tile $r$** is counted from the bottom:

- **$r = 1$ for the last row**,
- **$r = 2$ for the middle row**,
- **$r = 3$ for the top row**.

A configuration is solvable if and only if:

$$
\text{parity of the number of inversions} + \text{parity of } r \equiv 0 \pmod{2}
$$

In other words:

- If $ext{inv}(\sigma)$ is **even**, then $r$ must be **odd**.
- If $ext{inv}(\sigma)$ is **odd**, then $r$ must be **even**.

Thus, revisiting our previous example:

- Number of inversions **even (12)**.
- The empty space is in **row 1** (last row) → $r = 1$ (odd).

$12 + 1 = 13$ (odd)

Since the final solved state has $0 + 1 = 1$ (odd), **this configuration is solvable**.

# **Maximum Moves Required to Solve the Puzzle**

The number of moves required to solve a sliding puzzle depends on the optimal path from any given configuration to the solved state. This is determined using two key concepts:

## **Manhattan Distance**

The Manhattan distance is a measure of how far a given configuration is from the solved state. It is defined as:

$$
d = \sum\_{i=1}^{8} \left( |x\_i - x\_i^*| + |y\_i - y\_i^*| \right)
$$

where:

- $(x\_i, y\_i)$ represents the current coordinates of tile $i$,
- $(x\_i^*, y\_i^*)$ represents the correct coordinates of tile $i$ in the solved state.

For example, consider this configuration:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 8 & 3 \\
1 & 6 & 4 \\
7 & \_ & 5
\end{array}
$$

The goal state is:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & \_
\end{array}
$$

Calculating the Manhattan distance for each tile:

- **Tile 1**: $|2-1| + |0-1| = 2$
- **Tile 2**: $|0-0| + |1-0| = 1$
- **Tile 3**: Already correct
- **Tile 4**: $|1-1| + |0-2| = 2$
- **Tile 5**: $|1-2| + |1-2| = 2$
- **Tile 6**: $|1-1| + |2-1| = 1$
- **Tile 7**: Already correct
- **Tile 8**: $|2-0| + |1-1| = 2$

Total Manhattan distance:

$$
2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 10
$$

## **Empirical Results and Upper Bound**

The **maximum number of moves required to solve a 3×3 sliding puzzle** has been empirically determined.

### **Total Possible States and Solvable Configurations**

A $3 \times 3$ puzzle contains **9 spaces**, with **8 tiles** and **one empty space**. Each configuration can be seen as a permutation of **8 tiles** with a given empty tile position.

- The number of permutations of the 8 tiles: $8! = 40320$
- Since the empty space can be in 9 different positions, the total number of states: $9! = 362880$

However, due to parity constraints, **only half of the configurations are solvable**, leading to:

$$
\frac{9!}{2} = 181440
$$

# **Conclusion**

1. **A 3×3 sliding puzzle is solvable if and only if the parity of the number of inversions matches the parity of the empty tile’s row.**
2. **The maximum number of moves required to solve any solvable configuration is 31.**
